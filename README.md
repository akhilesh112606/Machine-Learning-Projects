# 📌 Project - 1: Diabetic Level Estimation using BMI

This project implements **Simple Linear Regression (SLR)** to estimate a person's **diabetic level** based on their **Body Mass Index (BMI)**. It demonstrates the application of basic regression techniques in a health-related context using real-world-inspired data.

## 🧠 Problem Statement

Given the BMI of individuals, predict their diabetes level to assist in early health risk assessment and monitoring.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Python**
- **Pandas**
- **NumPy**
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn**
- **Scikit-learn (sklearn)**

---

## 🔍 Workflow

1. **Data Loading and Inspection**  
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
3. **Data Preprocessing**  
4. **Model Building with Simple Linear Regression**  
5. **Model Evaluation** using R² Score, MAE, MSE, and RMSE  
6. **Visualization** of Regression Line and Predictions
