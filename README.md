# 📌 Project - 1: Diabetic Level Estimation using BMI

This project implements **Simple Linear Regression (SLR)** to estimate a person's **diabetic level** based on their **Body Mass Index (BMI)**. It demonstrates the application of basic regression techniques in a health-related context using real-world-inspired data.

---

## 🧠 Problem Statement

Given the BMI of individuals, predict their diabetes level to assist in early health risk assessment and monitoring.

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Python**
- **Pandas**
- **NumPy**
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn**
- **Scikit-learn (sklearn)**

---

## 🔍 Workflow

1. **Data Loading and Inspection**  
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
3. **Data Preprocessing**  
4. **Model Building with Simple Linear Regression**  
5. **Model Evaluation** using R² Score, MAE, MSE, and RMSE  
6. **Visualization** of Regression Line and Predictions

---

## 📊 Results & Observations

- Positive correlation observed between BMI and diabetic level  
- Simple Linear Regression provided a decent fit for the given data  
- Regression performance visualized and evaluated effectively using standard metrics

# 📌 Project - 2: House Price Prediction in California using Multiple Linear Regression

This project applies **Multiple Linear Regression** on a real-time **California Housing dataset** to predict house prices based on various influencing features. A perfect case to explore regression in the real estate domain.

---

## 🧠 Problem Statement

Given multiple features like median income, population, location, and house age — predict the median house price in various regions of California.

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib & Seaborn  
- Scikit-learn

---

## 🔍 Workflow

1. Data loading and cleaning  
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
3. Feature selection and correlation analysis  
4. Model building using Multiple Linear Regression  
5. Model evaluation (R², MAE, MSE, RMSE)  
6. Visualization of predictions vs actuals

---

## 📊 Results & Observations

- Strong correlation found between income and house price  
- Model achieved reasonable accuracy with low error rates  
- Visualizations helped interpret the feature impact clearly
